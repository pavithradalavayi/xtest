I have Used Angular Framework
Create a new project > ng new PROJECT NAME
Generate a component > ng g c home
Generate service for interacting data > ng g service api

For run the application > ng serve
For deploy the project > ng build --prod

Directly run he project by using Xammp server by installing dist folder in the current root folder of the project.
